      <li>
        <strong>1917</strong> - He got the opportunity to join the University of Calcutta as the first Palit Professor of Physics. Raman happily resigned from his government post to take up this position though the new job paid much less than the previous one. Such was his dedication to science.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1919</strong> - He was made the Honorary Secretary of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, a post he held till 1933. He was very popular and many students gathered around him, attracted by his immense knowledge of science.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1928</strong> - Discovery of what came to be known as ‘Raman Effect’ which he presented at a meeting of scientists
      </li>
	<li><strong>1930</strong> - He won Nobel Prize in Physics "for his work on the scattering of light and for the discovery of the Raman Effect", becoming the first Indian to win a Nobel Prize in the sciences.
	</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1933</strong> - He was invited by the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore to become its Director.He accepted the post in 1933, becoming the first Indian to hold this post.

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1948</strong> - He established the Raman Research Institute (RRI) in Bangalore for conducting scientific research in different fields of physics. He continued with his research in the institute till his death.      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each
        season, doubling wheat yields
